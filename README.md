# Network
 
My implementation of CS50W's '[Network](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/4/network/)' assignment - a Twitter-like social media application written in Python and JavaScript. Users are able to post, edit, and like messages, as well as follow other users.

_Assignment in progress._
